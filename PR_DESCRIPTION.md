# Report Delivery
chimera report send --to admin@company.com --subject "Daily System Report"
chimera report list --limit 10
```

### 🔒 Phase 5: Security Auditing Integration

#### Comprehensive Security Auditor
- **7 major security tools** integration: auditd, AIDE, rkhunter, chkrootkit, ClamAV, OpenSCAP, Lynis
- **Automated vulnerability scanning** and compliance checking
- **Historical audit tracking** with database storage
